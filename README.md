# Recursive sudoku solver

## What is this?

This is a project I wanted to create in order to properly understand the concept of **recursion** and its use-cases.
It just so happened that I was too lazy to create a sudoku game generator, so here I also practiced website parsing.
All "auto-filled" sudoku games are taken directly from [here](https://nine.websudoku.com/).

## Usage example

> TBD

## Requirements

python >= 3.10
